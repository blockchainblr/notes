### Apache Big data projects
- **Apache Ambari** makes hadoop cluster provisioning, managing and monitoring very simple.
- **Apache Avro** is a data serialization system
- **Apache Bigtop** builds a community around the packaging and interoperatibility testing of Hadoop related projects. It includes testing at various levels developed by a community with a focus oon the system as a whole, rather than individual projects.
- **Apache Falcon** is a data processing and management solution for Hadoop, designed for data motion, coordination and data pipelines, lifecycle management, and data discovery. End consumers can quickly onboard their data and its associated processing and management tasks on Hadoop clusters.
- **Apache Flume** is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficient collecting, aggregating and moving large amounts of log data from many different sources to a centralized data store.
- **Apache Kafka** is a distributed, fault tolerant, publish-subscribe messaging.
- **Apache Knox**  is a REST API gateway for Hadoop services.
- **Apache OOzie** is a workflow scheduler system to manage Hadoop jobs.
- **Apache Parquet** is a general-purpose columnar storage format, built for Hadoop, usable with any choice of data processing framework, data model, or programming language.
- **Apache Phoenix** is a relational database layer on top of Apache HBase.
- **Apache Samza** is a distributed stream processing framework.
- **Apache Spark** is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.
- **Apache Sqoop** is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between Apache Hadoop and structured detesters such as relational databases.
- **Apache Storm** is a distributed real-time computation system.
- **Apache Tez** is an effort to develop generic application framework which can be used to process arbitrarily complex directed-acyclic graphs(DAGs) of data-processing tasks and also re-usable set of data processing primitives which can be used by other projects.
- **Apache Helix** is a cluster management framework for partitioned and replicated distributed resources.
- **Apache Mesos** is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed applications, or frameworks.
- **Apache Sentry** is a system for enforcing fine grained role based authorization to data and metadata stored on a Hadoop Cluster
